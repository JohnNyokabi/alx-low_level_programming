## 0x0B-malloc_free
This directory contains introductory projects on Allocating, Reallocating and Deallocating memory to programs.

## Requirements
	1). Ubuntu 20.04LTS
	2). gcc compiler

## Descriptions
1). 0-create_array.c - creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char and returns pointer to the array, or NULL if the size is 0 or if it fails.

2). 1-strdup.c - The function returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

3). 2-str_concat.c - function that concatenates two strings. The returned pointer points to a newly allocated space in memory that contains the contents of s1, followed by the contents of s2, and null terminated.

4). 3-alloc_grid.c - The function returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.

5). 4-free_grid.c - The program frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.

6). 100-argstostr.c - The function concatenates all arguments of the program, and returns a pointer to a new string, or NULL if it fails.

7). 101-strtow.c - The program splits a string into words, and  returns a pointer to an array of strings (words).Every element of the array contains asingle word and null terminated.
